This is my first React app, based on the Edamam API. I made it before learning Redux, so events and API calls are handled by local states. It started as the homework described below.

Homework for working with Promises (via fetch) and updating react state

if you see `STRETCH GOAL` - think of it as an optional additional challenge.
if you see `DOUBLE STRETCH GOAL` - think of it as an optional additional challenge that is probably twice as hard as a regular stretch goal.

## Assignment
1. On initialization of the application, make an api request to the edamam api for cakes and display a list of cake names and the calories for the cake recipe by updating the react state via `setState()`
    - https://developer.edamam.com/edamam-recipe-api <--- go here and sign up for a develop account, this will provide you with an api key
    - A good idea would be to create a constant to construct your `GET` endpoint
    ```js 
    const APP_ID = ''; // your app id here, provided to you when you sign up
    const APP_KEY = ''; // your app key here, provided to you when you sign up
    
    // this would be what I would make for the final URL
    const BASE_ENDPOINT = `https://api.edamam.com/search?app_id=${APP_ID}&app_key=${APP_KEY}`;
    // an example API request with a cake query would be
    // `${BASE_ENDPOINT}&q=cake`
    ```
    - Use the React lifecycle hook of [`ComponentDidMount`](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html) and make your `fetch` request in there
    - `STRETCH GOAL` - Create a function based component for each recipe item, where you pass in props ie:
    ```jsx
       <div class="recipe-list">
           {/* This should hopefully give you some direction, but ask your TAs for help if you're stuck! */}
           {this.state.recipeList.map(recipe => <Recipe someProps />)}
       </div>
    ```

2. Handle Errors. If you get an error (lets say you turn off the internet connection)
    - All you need is to have a message of your choice display *INSTEAD* of a list of recipes
    - `STRETCH GOAL` - Make a function for displaying an error, and conditionally show the right one
    - `DOUBLE STRETCH GOAL` - look into creating a [`higher order component`](https://reactjs.org/docs/higher-order-components.html) that can conditionally show either an error or a list!

3. `STRETCH GOAL` - Make the API request happen in a reusable function that if given a string, will search the api for that string
4. `DOUBLE STRETCH GOAL` - Implement a search bar (like you may have in previous assignments) - where the result of the search text generates a new list, ie - search for pies instead of cakes
5. `STRETCH GOAL` - Write any kind of test for any component you make! Remember you can look at the default test file here as a reference
